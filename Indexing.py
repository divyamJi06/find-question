#indexing in dictionary is not based on numbers, individual keys are the index.
#--> beacuse of this reason the keys are supposed to be unique

additive_inverse_dict = {1:-1,2:-2,3:-3,4:-4,5:-5}

print(additive_inverse_dict[1])
#print(additive_inverse_dict[0]) # if key does not exist it will raise KeyError

#why don't we use numbers as index--> dictionary is unordered

#a large dictionary when printed multiple times will give a different output each time
